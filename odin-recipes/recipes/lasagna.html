        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish consisting of layers of flat pasta sheets, typically alternating with various ingredients such as tomato sauce, meat (such as ground beef, pork, or sausage), cheese (such as mozzarella, ricotta, or parmesan), and sometimes vegetables (such as spinach or mushrooms). The layers are then baked until the pasta is cooked and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Lasagna is known for its rich and hearty flavor, making it a favorite comfort food for many.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 Sheets Lasagna Noodles</li>
        <li>1 Pound Ground Beef or Pork</li>
        <li>1 Medium Onion, Finely Chopped</li>
        <li>2 Cloves Garlic, Minced</li>
        <li>2 Cups Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>2 Cups Ricotta Cheese</li>
        <li>2 Cups Mozzarella Cheese, Shredded</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup Parmesan Cheese, Grated</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon Salt</li>
        <li>1/2 Teaspoon Black Pepper</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon Dried Basil</li>

    </ul>

        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven</strong>: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Noodles</strong>: Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente (firm but not too soft). Drain them and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce</strong>: In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions and garlic, if using, and sauté until they are soft and translucent. If adding meat, brown it in the skillet with the onions and garlic. Once the meat is cooked, add the tomato sauce and herbs (such as basil, oregano, salt, and pepper). Let the sauce simmer for about 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Cheese Mixture</strong>: In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella cheese, grated parmesan cheese, and any additional herbs and spices to taste. This mixture will be used as one of the layers in the lasagna.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagna</strong>: In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of the sauce on the bottom. Arrange a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, slightly overlapping them. Spread a layer of the cheese mixture evenly over the noodles. Repeat the layers: sauce, noodles, cheese mixture, until all ingredients are used, ending with a layer of sauce on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake</strong>: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the lasagna is bubbly and the cheese is golden brown on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest and Serve</strong>: Once baked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the lasagna to set and makes it easier to cut into neat portions. Enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!</li>
